<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist material market comprises two main types: positive photoresist and negative photoresist. Positive photoresist becomes soluble when exposed to light, allowing the developer to wash away the exposed areas, leaving behind the desired pattern. Negative photoresist, on the other hand, hardens upon exposure, making the exposed regions insoluble while the unexposed areas are developed away. These materials are critical in microfabrication processes, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing and printed circuit board production, enabling precise circuit patterning.</p></p>
